        title: 'Chicken and Coconut Rice With Nuoc Cham Tomatoes',
        description: `Rich, coconutty, schmaltzy, bright, funky, and tangy, this skillet chicken dinner tantalizes the taste 
        buds on every level. Skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs are seasoned simply with salt and lots of pepper, 
        then cooked skin side down in a skillet until the fat renders and you’re left with perfectly crisp skin. 
        You’ll sizzle garlic and a mountain of shallots in the leftover rich schmaltz, which will flavor the sunny 
        yellow coconut cream and turmeric rice that cooks in the pan with the chicken thighs as the meat finishes roasting.`,
